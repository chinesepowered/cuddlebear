# 🧸 CuddleBear AI - Your Conversational AI Companion

## Inspiration

In a world increasingly dominated by cold, screen-based interactions, we noticed a fundamental gap: people crave warmth, physical comfort, and genuine connection—especially children facing bedtime fears, elderly individuals experiencing loneliness, and those with special needs seeking patient companionship. 

We were inspired by the simple yet profound realization that the most comforting childhood memories often involve a trusted teddy bear. What if that bear could not only provide physical comfort but also engage in meaningful, intelligent conversations? What if it could remember your stories, offer encouragement during tough times, and be available 24/7 with the patience and wisdom of advanced AI?

CuddleBear AI bridges the gap between the digital intelligence we've achieved and the physical comfort we still need as humans.

## What it does

CuddleBear AI transforms a traditional teddy bear into an intelligent conversational companion by embedding:

- **Natural Speech Recognition**: Simply talk to your bear—no wake words needed in quiet environments
- **Intelligent Conversations**: Powered by AWS Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet for empathetic, contextual responses  
- **Expressive Voice Synthesis**: Responds with warm, natural speech through Amazon Polly
- **Continuous Learning**: Remembers conversations and personalizes interactions over time
- **Multi-User Support**: Recognizes different family members and adapts accordingly

**Real-World Applications:**
- **Children**: Bedtime stories, homework help, emotional support during difficult times
- **Elderly Care**: Daily companionship, memory stimulation, medication reminders through conversation
- **Therapy Support**: Speech therapy practice, autism social skills development, anxiety management
- **Healthcare**: Comfort during medical procedures, post-surgery emotional support

## How we built it

### Hardware Architecture
- **Raspberry Pi 4B**: Core processing unit running containerized applications
- **High-Quality Audio System**: Omnidirectional USB microphone + stereo speakers
- **Custom Bear Integration**: Electronics seamlessly embedded in soft, huggable teddy bear
- **Power Management**: 10,000mAh battery for 8+ hours of conversation
- **Secure Connectivity**: Wi-Fi connection to AWS cloud services

### AWS Cloud Integration
```
Conversation Flow:
Bear Microphone → AWS IoT Core → Amazon Transcribe → AWS Bedrock (Claude) → Amazon Polly → Bear Speaker
```

**Core AWS Services Used:**
